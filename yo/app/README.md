# Rest Client App
This is the web app client accompanying our awesome server logic.  
This app is all about consuming and producing data from and for the lectures.

Create a graph, a lecture room, an account.  
Display all of that stuff.

## Tips:

### TODO:
Search for `TODO` in all files and you will find stuff that still needs to be fine tuned.
A hit may refer to a problem that has no issue on the tracker, so search here from time to time.
This is especially advised before every sprint and when you have a bunch of free time.

### Build:
If the server is running nicely there is no need to redeploy the whole stuff when all you want to do is tinker in Javascript files.
Simply leave glassfish running and the app deployed.
Fire up `grunt:serve` in a terminal emulator of your choice and enjoy speedy redeploys.
When ready for the next big show, simply use the maven redeploy goal.

## Further Information:
Take a look at the '../README.md'.  
Also check out the documentation repo.
Maybe something new sneaked into it.
