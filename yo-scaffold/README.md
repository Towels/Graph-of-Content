#Proposed GoC Scaffolding
Scaffolding for GoC REST Client.

##Technology

- Bower: Easy dependency management (JS, HTML, CSS libs)
- Grunt: "Does it all" - Lint, Minify, Compile
- Compass: Compile SASS to CSS
- AngularJS: Javascript MVC Easy-Mode Framework
- REST: Get stuff out of storage and put new stuff into it (eventually)

##Prerequisit

- Ruby: >=2.0.0*
- Node: >=0.10.0*
- Bundle: `gem install bundle`
- Bower: `npm install -g bower`
- Grunt: `npm install -g grunt`

_\* possibly lower, untested_

```
npm install
bundle install
bower install
